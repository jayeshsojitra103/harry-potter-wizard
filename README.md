# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jayeshsojitra103/harry-potter-wizard.git
cd harry-potter-wizard

```

### Install dependencies:

```npm install```

### Run the application:

```npm run dev```

### Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ to see the application in action.

## Usage

- Apply Filters: Enter values into the filter textboxes to filter the list of elixirs.
- Reset Filters: Click on the "Reset Filters" button to clear all applied filters and view the full list.
- Loading State: A loading spinner will appear while the application is fetching the list of elixirs.
- Error Handling: If an error occurs during data fetching, an error message will be shown to the user.

## Limitations
- The filters are textboxes without any input validation.
- Filters are optional and can be left empty to display all elixirs.
